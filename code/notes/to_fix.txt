need to fix channel number f parameters an d restrict the nae to contain no spaces

plus the length of the channel ame to be under 200 characters

make the one that creates the channel it's operator.

   The commands which may only be used by channel operators are:

        KICK    - Eject a client from the channel
        MODE    - Change the channel's mode
        INVITE  - Invite a client to an invite-only channel (mode +i)
        TOPIC   - Change the channel topic in a mode +t channel

   A channel operator is identified by the '@' symbol next to their
   nickname whenever it is associated with a channel (ie replies to the
   NAMES, WHO and WHOIS commands).

     check if the error messages are well displayed
     remove the admin for the user if he leaves the channel
     check the commands parsing for any error
